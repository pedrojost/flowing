Feature branch: Development of new resources, are generated from the develop branch (next releases).

Follow these steps for starting and finishing a new feature for the project`s source control:

Type in terminal:
git flow feature start new-feature-name  //This action creates a new feature branch based on 'develop' and switches to it

Develop the feature, add it`s file(s) on the active feature branch:
git add new-feature-file.txt

commit it:
git commit -m ‘done new feature’

then finish it by merging the new committed feature files to the develop branch with the following terminal command:
git flow feature finish new-feature-name

Situational:
For developing in collaboration, first publish the feature to the remote server so it can be used by other users by typing (do this before finishing the feature):
git flow feature  new-shared—feature-name

Then, you can track a feature on a origin by using:
git flow feature track new-shared—feature-name
